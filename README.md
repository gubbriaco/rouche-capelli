# rouche-capelli
Python application that implements the Rouche-Capelli Theorem

This application allows to establish whether a linear system, described by an incomplete matrix A and a vector of the known terms b, admits solutions and, if necessary, quantify them through the study of the rank of the incomplete matrix A and of the matrix obtained by concatenation of A and b . In addition, there is a plot that represents the 3D planes of the equations associated with the system.
